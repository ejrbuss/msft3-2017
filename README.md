### Our Team

[@torreyr](https://github.com/torreyr) and I took part in MSFT3C at the University of Victoria as team <b><i style="color:brown">hot-chocolate</i></b> (yum yum). This repository contains the code I wrote for the competition.

The code is written in JavaScript, and as the competition was only two hours a lot of it was rushed, so don't expect anything polished!
